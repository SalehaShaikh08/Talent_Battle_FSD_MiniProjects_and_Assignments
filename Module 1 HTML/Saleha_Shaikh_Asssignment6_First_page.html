    <p> <mark> Q6. Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains
        a heading and two paragraphs of text. Use the HTML tags h1, h1, p
        and /p in this exercise. As the texts in the heading and paragraphs you can
        use any texts you like.
        Add an unordered list to this web page.
        An unordered list can be specified with the tags ul and ul.
        An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be
        specified with tags li and /li.
        After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens
        when you convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags ul and ul with
        ol and ol, respectively.
        Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the
        img tag. As an image, you can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the
        Internet.

<h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>
<p>Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that develops algorithms by learning the hidden patterns of the datasets used it 
    to make predictions on new similar type data, without being explicitly programmed for each task.<br>
    Traditional Machine Learning combines data with statistical tools to predict an output that can be used to make actionable insights.
    Machine learning is used in many different applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing, 
    recommendation systems, fraud detection, portfolio optimization, automated task, and so on. Machine learning models are also 
    used to power autonomous vehicles,drones, and robots, making them more intelligent and adaptable to changing environments.<br>
    A typical machine learning tasks are to provide a recommendation. Recommender systems are a common application of machine learning,
    and they use historical data to provide personalized recommendations to users. In the case of Netflix, the system uses a combination 
    of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend movies and TV shows to users based on their viewing history, 
   ratings, and other factors such as genre preferences.<br>

    Reinforcement learning is another type of machine learning that can be used to improve recommendation-based systems. 
    In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions based on feedback from its environment, and this feedback can be used 
    to improve the recommendations provided to users. For example, the system could track how often a user watches a recommended movie
     and use this feedback to adjust the recommendations in the future. </p>
