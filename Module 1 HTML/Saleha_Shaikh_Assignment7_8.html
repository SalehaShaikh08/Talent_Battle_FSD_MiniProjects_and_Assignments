    <p><mark> Q7. Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs.
        You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into
        the same folder where your first .html is. After you have created the new .html
        page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load another_page.html
        when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use
        the a and a tags in this exercise. Inside the tag a you need to use a
        href attribute that specifies which page will be loaded when the link is clicked.</mark></p>
        <p> <mark>Q8 .HTML tags like a can have certain attributes. The href attribute is 
            mandatory in the a tag. Additionally, it is possible to use the title attribute 
            which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a 
            link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the 
            previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when 
            the mouse cursor is over the link.

<h1><u>Machine Learning</u></h1>
<p><b>Arthur Samuel,</b> a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and computer gaming, coined the term <b>"Machine Learning".</b>
     He defined machine learning as - a "Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed".
      In a very layman"s manner, Machine Learning(ML) can be explained as automating and improving the learning process of computers based
       on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance. The process starts with feeding good 
       quality data and then training our machines(computers) by building machine learning models using the data and different algorithms. 
       The choice of algorithms depends on what type of data we have and what kind of task we are trying to automate.</p>
